# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
		* In Javascript, objects are variable types that contain other variables in key value pairs, those values can be any variable type, including objects
	* Properties
		* Properties are the variables of an object, identified by their key.
	* Methods
		* Methods are properties of an object that are functions.
	* for in loop
		* The for in loop in Javascript is similar to a basic for loop but it iterates over an object's keys or an array's indices.
	* dot notation vs bracket notation
		* Circumstance will dictate wether to use dot or bracket notation to access an object's properties. Most of the time the dot notation will be used, such as:
		``` js
		object.height = 17;
		```
		When the key is stored in another variable however, bracket notation must be used:
		``` js
		var key = 'x';
		object[key]+= 80;
		```


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.
